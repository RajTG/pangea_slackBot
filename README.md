# Slack Sentry

It checks the posted messages in Slack by using Pangea's URL intel API and posts alerts in the slack channel and also creates a Jira issue if the link is found to be malicious. The slack bot is built with Python and Flask. I also used Slack and Jira SDKs. For demo, the bot runs on the local machine with ngrok exposing it to the internet. The ngrok link is used by the bot to subscribe to Slack events.
